## problem 1


```{r}
data("instacart")
instacart = janitor::clean_names(instacart)
head(instacart)
skimr::skim(instacart)
head(instacart, n=1)
```

This "instacart" dataset documents the shoppoing history of different client. From the table above, we know that there are total 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Among these 15 variables, 4 of them are character variables ("aisle", "department", "eval_set", "product_name"), and the others are all numeric variables. 

There are 15 variables in this dataset:

order_id: order identifier
product_id: product identifier
add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart
reordered: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise
user_id: customer identifier
eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)
order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)
order_dow: the day of the week on which the order was placed
order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
days_since_prior_order: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if order_number=1
product_name: name of the product
aisle_id: aisle identifier
department_id: department identifier
aisle: the name of the aisle
department: the name of the department

For example, the first line in the dataset, user with user_id 112108 placed an order(order_id: 1), buying Bulgarian Yogurt at 10am on Thursday. And the order is this user's fourth order.

## Answer questions
*How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?*
```{r}
n_distinct(instacart$aisle)

instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_aisle = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_aisle))
```
